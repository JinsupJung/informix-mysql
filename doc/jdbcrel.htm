Driver lets Java programmers
access <span class="keyword">Informix</span> databases
from within Java applications

to connect to an <span class="keyword">Informix</span> database
server, retrieve data from the database, and handle errors. The <span class="keyword">Informix JDBC
Driver</span> can
also be used for writing user-defined routines that are run on an <span class="keyword">Informix</span> database
server. The <span class="keyword">IBM Informix JDBC Driver</span> is
compatible with the JavaSoft JDBC specifications. The <span class="keyword">Informix JDBC
Driver</span> maps
standard Java data types and <span class="keyword">Informix</span> data
types.</p>
